# bikesharing

## Overview: 

New York City is a top destination for people of all backgrounds looking to live in a fast paced city or explore all it has to offer. One of the downfalls of New York is that there is not much space which makes owning a bike a challange. Using Citi Bikes creates a wonderful experience for all those in the city, tourists and residents alike. This analysis looks into the feasability of bringing the explosive rideshare program to Des Moines, Iowa.

We will be looking at rideshare data from August 2019 for this analysis.  After cleaning up the data using pandas in Jupyter Notebook, the data will be visualized with Tableau.

## Results:

The majority of riders are interested in short rides (less than 1 hour). Looking at the graph the majority of rides used the bikes for 5 minutes. There was a steady decline of users after 5 minutes with a plateau after 1 hour.

Ridership can be seen to follow traditional commuting hours to work over the weekdays (7AM-9AM, 5PM-7PM). Over weekends, checkout times are can be seen to be spread out during the day (10AM-6PM).

The top starting locations can be seen to be in lower Manhatten where tourism and offices are high.

Top ending locations are also conentrated around lower Manhatten which is to be expected as majority of rides use Citi Bikes for 5 minutes.

Taking a look at which genders use this service, we see the majority  of riders are male.

Although females use the service at a lower frequency, use times are similar between both groups.

Breaking down gender use by days of the week, we see that females use this service at a higher rate over weekends while men use this service over weekdays (Thursdays and Fridays being the highest use days)

## Summary: 

By breaking down ridership by gender, use duration, trips by day of the week, and staring/ending locations we are able to take a better look at rider trends. The majority of people who use this service are males who commute to and from work. Comparing this to the demographics of De Moins, Iowa would give a better understanding of how successful this program could be. We could also take a look at the age of those who use Citi Bikes as well as most used stations.
